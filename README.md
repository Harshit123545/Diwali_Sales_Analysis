# Diwali_Sales_Analysis
 In the Diwali Sales Analysis project, I cleaned and manipulated data to ensure accuracy and performed EDA using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I identified high-potential customer segments based on demographics like state, occupation, gender, and age, and analyzed top-selling products and categories to optimize inventory.
